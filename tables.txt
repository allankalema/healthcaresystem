so this system is a medical system that will help in tracking pregannet mothers  antenatal care routine
it should be usabel byt the doctors hospitals and the mothers 
so I need a base.html and In the  base I need an that is responsive to the  big and small screen on big screens we have  it at the top as an app bar with a health pregnant green color    it should have the following on it (home, dashboard, my prescriptions, and the profile icone that will be a drop down having the following options update profile, emergency, change password, login, signup, logout, )
and wen the  screen gets the app bar will stay with only the  profile drop down in the corner but the  on the left we will have a hamburger button that wen pressed it will get a slider that slides in from the left to half  the page and will have the other buttons 
the app bar should have the  tittle Matternal healthcare on it on big screen it should've on the left the other button left aligned and on small  screens it should be in the middle coexisting with the humbuerger btuttton and the  profile that wud have  stayed  the slider should be the same  color as the  app bar and we need to implement the fuctionlait where the slider once brought up and u tap anywhere outside the screen it goes back (same with the  profile drop down,, in the side slider at its bottom u can put the  copyright and all that )
we are using the tailwind CSS and HTML thisbase of for a  django project do make sure all buttons are #  but written in a django manner structure 
and lately  the colors u use make sure they are health related and they look nice and   a bit of animations would be nice
below the app bar you need to provide a  dive that will handle both success and error messages  where they will animately pop over anything that will be written there they last for 5 seconds and they disappear and even they have a  cancel icon which wen pressen can disappear wen the time ain't yet .. both success and error messages will use ther (we shall use light green and light red to  design the error div)
 help me set that up thank you
